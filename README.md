Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project Repo

This repository contains code for the final project in the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course

The code completes the following steps:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Code are commented throughout for clarity. 

Note: the code assumes the data files used are in the working directory. If this is not the case, the user will need to modify read.csv commands at the beginning of the code to direct to the directories containing the input files.
